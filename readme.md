# A reasonable Emacs config

Based on: Steve Purcell

## Installation

M-x irony-install-server

## Important note about `ido`

This config enables `ido-mode` completion in the minibuffer wherever
possible, which might confuse you when trying to open files using
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, e.g. when you want to open a directory to use
`dired` -- if you get stuck, use <kbd>C-f</kbd> to drop into the
regular `find-file` prompt. (You might want to customize the
`ido-show-dot-for-dired` variable if this is an issue for you.)
